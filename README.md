# Battleship Game

A modern implementation of the classic Battleship game built with JavaScript. This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

## Description

Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of ships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling attacking the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

## Features

- Two game modes:
  - Player vs Computer
  - Player vs Player (local multiplayer)
- Intelligent computer opponent
  - Smart targeting system that focuses on adjacent cells after a hit
  - Uses BFS algorithm to efficiently hunt ships
- Interactive ship placement
  - Manual placement with rotation
  - Random placement option
- Real-time game feedback
- Modern UI
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Jest
- Webpack
- npm

## Learned Skills

- Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and practices
- Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript
- Factory Functions and Module Pattern
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm implementation
- Closure and scope in JavaScript
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Webpack configuration and module bundling

    npm test
    ```
5. Build for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
6. Deploy:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you're on main branch and all changes are committed
    git checkout main
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push origin main
    
    # Then run deploy script
    npm run deploy
    ```


## How to Play
1. Choose game mode (Computer or 2-Player)
2. Enter player name(s)
3. Place your ships:
   - Click "Change Axis" to rotate ships
   - Click on the board to place ships
   - Use "Randomize" for quick placement
4. Take turns attacking opponent's board
5. First player to sink all enemy ships wins!
  
## Testing
- The project follows Test-Driven Development principles using Jest. Tests cover:

  - Ship creation and damage tracking
  - Gameboard ship placement and attack logic
  - Player turn management and game flow
